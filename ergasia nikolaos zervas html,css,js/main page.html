  <h1>Brazilian jiu-jitsu</h1>
  <p>Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ; Portuguese: jiu-jitsu brasileiro) is a self-defence martial art and combat sport based on grappling, 
	ground fighting, and submission holds. BJJ focuses on taking ones opponent down to the ground, gaining a dominant position, 
	and using a number of techniques to force them into submission via joint locks or chokeholds.

	Brazilian jiu-jitsu was first developed in 1925 by Brazilian brothers Carlos, Oswaldo, Gastão Jr., 
	and Hélio Gracie, after Carlos was taught a hybrid of traditional Japanese Jujitsu and Kodokan judo by a travelling Japanese judoka, 
	Mitsuyo Maeda, in 1917. Later on, the Gracie family developed their own self-defense system Gracie Jiu-Jitsu.
	
	BJJ eventually came to be its own defined combat sport through the innovations, practices, 
	and adaptation of Gracie jiu-jitsu and judo, and became an essential martial art for modern MMA.
	
	BJJ revolves around the concept that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend themselves against a bigger, stronger, 
	heavier opponent by using leverage and weight distribution, taking the fight to the ground and using a number of holds and submissions to defeat them. 
	BJJ training can be used for sport grappling and self-defense situations.[3] Sparring, commonly referred to as "rolling" within the BJJ community, 
	and live drilling plays a major role in training and the practitioner's development. BJJ can also be used as a method of promoting physical fitness, building character, and as a way of life.
